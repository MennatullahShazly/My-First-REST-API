## Introduction:

A REST API, or Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and conventions that allow different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet.
It is a way for one program to request and exchange data with another program, typically using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as the communication protocol.

In simple terms, think of a REST API like a menu at a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with descriptions of each dish. You (the client) can choose a dish (make a request) from the menu, and the kitchen (the server) will prepare and serve the dish as specified. In this analogy, the menu is like the API, and the dishes are like the data or actions that the API provides.

REST APIs use standard HTTP methods such as GET (retrieve data), POST (create data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data) to perform operations on resources (like data objects) that are identified by URLs. These methods allow you to interact with a server and request or manipulate data, similar to how you interact with a restaurant's kitchen to order and receive food.

Overall, REST APIs enable different software systems to talk to each other, share data, and perform actions over the internet, making them a fundamental part of modern web and mobile application development.
